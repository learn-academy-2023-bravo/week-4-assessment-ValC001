# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object oriented programming is creating a program with objects that have certain attributes. The objects can have methods like Up,Left,Click ,etc. Its basically like building a house out of different materials in minecraft. You can make the house big,small,tall or short but in the end the result will still be a house but how you got there is different.  Functional programming is creating a program with an instruction set, so you'll be building a house but it'll be the same house everytime. The difference with the two is that one you could get creative with it while the other not so much.

Researched answer:  Object oriented programming  is a data structure that defines objects with its own attributes. Programs are created/designed by using the objects with different attributes that will interact with each other. Functional programming on the other hand uses expressions & functions that won't be mutating the state and data. The difference with the two is how flexible OOP is compared to functional.

Researched answer:

1. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: It means that it will automatically return the value of last evaluated expression in your method if you don't use return to return a value.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A ruby block is a code functionality that gets passed to a method. Its defined with "do" ,"end" & "{}"

Researched answer: Chunks of code enclosed within {}

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: By using fetch or "[]'

Researched answer:  You can extract a value from a ruby hash by using fetch/[]. For example. 
          example_array = {name: "Valeria, city: "San Diego", pet: "Cat"}
          pet = example_array[:cat]

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: RSpec is a testing tool for ruby. According to research its used for testing ruby and ruby on rails programs.

2. Test-driven development: Its a software devolpment process , its kind of like jest test. It tests the software/program multiple times to make sure it works.

3. PostgreSQL: Open source database management system used for SQL compliance & extensibility. It works as a data warehouse for a lot of different applications.

4. CRUD: Create, read, update & delete

5. HTTP: Hypertext transfer program. From my research it seems like its similar to HTML and is used to help complete apps.
